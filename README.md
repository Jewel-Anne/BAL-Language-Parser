# BAL-Language-Parser
Basic &amp; Adaptable Language (BAL) is an Object-Oriented Programming Language inspired from Java Language. It aims to further improve exception handling, garbage collection, and memory allocation of the Java Language in pursuit of a new robust language.

BAL was developed by a group of 3rd-year students from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines under the program Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The group created this project in partial fulfillment of their subject Principles of Programming Languages. The name BAL was inspired by the term “Balbal” which means “slang” in the English Language. Balbal is an informal language used in everyday conversations.

In creating this program, the group decided to use Balbal because in general, Filipinos are fond of inventing words and borrowing foreign terms, so applying this in programming can help novice Filipino programmers enjoy coding. By using this kind of language, the group can also help beginners to not be overwhelmed by the complexity of the programming. They also decided to use Balbal because they believe that we can easily familiarize ourselves with programming concepts if we associate them with words that we usually encounter in our daily lives.
